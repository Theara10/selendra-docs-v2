## Philosophy

We believe in a multi-chain future with numerous chains, each hosting a diverse array of users and assets. In this context, we've introduced Selendra: a smart contract platform designed to offer both Wasm and EVM-compatible environment for crafting decentralized applications. Selendra was purpose-built to serve the evolving landscape of assets and users spanning multiple blockchain networks.

Traditional smart contract platforms are primarily engineered to cater to users and assets residing on a single, specific chain. Selendra, through its cross-chain smart contract functionality, empowers developers to smoothly transfer existing workloads and logic to the Selendra platform. This extension facilitates broader access to new users and assets across various chains.

Selendra's cross-chain integration is achieved by becoming a parachain or parathread on the Polkadot network. The Polkadot network serves as a hub for integration and connectivity among parachain network, connecting them to external non-Polkadot chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.

## Vision

Our goal is to bring every Cambodian internet user into the blockchain space.

We aim to do this by providing and supporting businesses, developers, and partners with the tools they need to build Web3 wallets for their existing and new users. We also aim to achieve this through use cases like cross-organization loyalty programs, reward exchanges, and settlement service and various tokenization methods. We envision Selendra as a launchpad for these users to access other blockchain networks.

## Why Building Selendra and Why Building on Substrate?

**Why We're Building Selendra**

In an era where blockchain technology has transitioned from a centralized, server-based internet (Web2) to a decentralized, distributed one (Web3), Selendra plays a crucial role. Web3 introduces decentralization (no single point of failure), censorship resistance, and permissionless access, enabling novel decentralized applications (dApps) and assets like DeFi, DEX, NFTs, and more.

The blockchain industry is still in its infancy, offering significant growth potential. The demand for Web3 developers has surged, signifying rapid adoption. Selendra was conceived to become an essential platform, nurturing the Web3 ecosystem's expansion.

**Why Build with Substrate**

After thorough research, we opted to build Selendra using the Substrate development framework and deploy it initially as an independent network. This approach allows us to focus on crafting use cases directly addressing enterprises' and developers' needs. As our developer community grows and demands scalability and interoperability, we can seamlessly integrate Substrate's toolkit, incorporating off-chain rollup for scalability, bridging methods, or parachains for interoperability with Polkadot.

Substrate aligns seamlessly with Selendra's technical requirements, offering a multitude of functionalities out of the box, such as peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance features, a Wasm contract pallet, an EVM implementation, and more.

In essence, adopting Substrate significantly reduces the time and effort required for realizing the Selendra project. Substrate's flexibility enables extensive customization, crucial for achieving our vision. Furthermore, utilizing Rust provides both safety assurances and performance optimizations.

Selendra's selection of the Substrate development framework represents a strategic decision rooted in several key advantages:

**1. Rapid Development and Deployment:** Substrate streamlines the development process, offering a wealth of functionalities out of the box. These include peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance features, a Wasm contract pallet, an EVM implementation, and more. Leveraging Substrate's existing components significantly reduces development time and effort for Selendra.

**2. Customization and Flexibility:** Substrate provides a high degree of customization, enabling Selendra to tailor its blockchain to meet specific requirements and goals. This flexibility is essential for realizing Selendra's vision of a decentralized infrastructure empowering enterprises and developers.

**3. Safety and Performance:** Substrate's use of Rust as its primary programming language ensures both safety guarantees and performance benefits. This ensures the reliability and efficiency of Selendra's blockchain, critical for building trust in the network.

**4. Integration with Polkadot Ecosystem:** Substrate serves as the foundation for Polkadot, aligning Selendra with the broader Polkadot ecosystem. This integration enables seamless connections with other blockchains within the Polkadot network, facilitating interoperability and expanding Selendra's reach.

**5. Interoperability:** Substrate's architecture is designed to enable interoperability, perfectly aligning with Selendra's cross-chain integration ambitions. This interoperability allows Selendra to connect with various blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, through bridges.

Polkadot Network and Ecosystem

The Polkadot network seamlessly complements Selendra's objectives. When Selendra becomes a parachain on Polkadot, it will facilitate token transfers between other parachains and parathreads within the network.

We can also leverage independently developed bridges to connect non-Polkadot chains to the network, including bridges to Ethereum. Polkadot's unique interoperability model aligns perfectly with Selendra's cross-chain integration ambitions, serving as a critical enabling technology for realizing the Selendra vision.

Equally significant as the technical considerations, we hold deep respect for the individuals within the Polkadot ecosystem and its community, including contributors from Parity, the Web3 Foundation, and various other projects. We extend our gratitude to them for creating exceptional tools that empower small teams like Selendra to achieve what was once unimaginable.

Selendra's strategic alignment with Substrate underscores its commitment to efficient, scalable, and interoperable development. It positions Selendra at the forefront of Web3 innovation, fostering a collaborative environment to drive the industry's evolution. Selendra extends its gratitude to the creators of Polkadot, Substrate, and the wider Web3 ecosystem for pioneering tools that empower projects like Selendra to turn the unimaginable into reality.

## Who Benefits from Selendra

Selendra's cross-chain functionality benefits three main user groups:

1. **Existing Ethereum-Based Projects**

   - Projects grappling with Ethereum's cost and scalability issues can migrate portions of their workloads to Selendra with minimal adjustments.
   - They can opt for a hybrid approach where applications coexist on both Ethereum and Selendra, expanding their reach to the Polkadot network and other connected chains.

2. **Polkadot Ecosystem Projects**

   - Ecosystem projects seeking smart contract functionality can enhance their existing parachains and parathreads.
   - These projects can introduce new features that may be lacking on the main Polkadot relay chain, such as crowdfunding mechanisms, lockdrops, and complex financial transactions.

3. **Developers of New DApps**
   - Individuals and teams venturing into Polkadot development can leverage Selendra to access specialized functionality from Polkadot parachains while reaching users and assets on other chains.
   - Selendra serves as a lightweight integration layer, simplifying the process of aggregating network services for developers. This pre-built integration on a smart contract platform offers a faster and easier alternative to building a complete Substrate runtime and conducting integrations from scratch.
