# Run A Full Node

When creating dApps or products on Substrate-based chains like Selendra, having the option to run your own backend node is key! This way, you can rely on your infrastructure, which offer more control and security.

To run a Full Node, simply follow this [guide](/documents/maintain/rpcnode/docker) then make sure you add:

```bash
--pruning archive
```

And remove:

```bash
â€”-validator
```
